Hello Ciara,

The ENCS usernames in this group are

   b_abou,c_nks,h_chausc,p_carlss

You have been given the "group account" hpc353_2 to do your project work
for this course. "group accounts" are needed so that you can share files
with your partners easily.

2 email aliases have been setup for your group. Sending email to either
hpc353_2@encs.concordia.ca or hp_comp353_2@encs.concordia.ca will send email
to each one of you.

Though you have a group account you do not have to login to it. You have
been added to the "hpc353_2" linux group and you can write in the following
directories:


    /groups/h/hp_comp353_2       This directory is where you should cd into
                                 and use while working on the project.
                                 It is *NOT* available on the web server!


    /www/groups/h/hp_comp353_2   This is the directory where you should place
                                 *ALL* the files to be viewable on the web.


You as a user do not have any disk quota on the above directories but the
linux group "hpc353_2" does. The above directories have the sgid bit set
(the 's' in 'rws' below) which means that any files or directories created
below these ones will automatically belong to the "hpc353_2" group

   permissions     owner       group        location
    drwxrws---    hpc353_2   hpc353_2      /groups/h/hp_comp353_2
    dr-xrws---    nul-web    hpc353_2      /www/groups/h/hp_comp353_2

(The web server initially runs as "nul-web" before switching to "hpc353_2".)


If you change the permissions of any directory under these make sure that
the 's' bit is on (use "chmod g+s name_of_subdirectory" to do so). If you
ever get a message that you are over quota please check the permissions of
the directory you are trying to write into.

The User ID  for web access is hpc353_2
The password for web access is HyperBlinkPunch43

The base URL for your web pages is

    https://hpc353.encs.concordia.ca/

Note: it is https not http! The web server will automatically redirect
       to https if the URL starts with http.


As an example you can create a foo.php in /www/groups/h/hp_comp353_2
that contains:

<HTML>
<HEAD>
   <TITLE>Date/Time Functions Demo</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>Date/Time Functions Demo</H1>
<P>The current date and time is
<EM><?echo date("D M d, Y H:i:s", time())?></EM>
<P>Current PHP version:
<EM><?echo  phpversion()?></EM>
</BODY>
</HTML>


Using the URL https://hpc353.encs.concordia.ca/foo.php
you would see something like

     Date/Time Functions Demo

     The current date and time is Wed Jan 12, 2022 10:10:43

     Current PHP version: 7.4.27


If you wish to connect from outside the ENCS network  using either
the mysql client program, Workbench, or from your own web server you
will have to use Concordia's VPN. Concordia blocks direct connections.

Please see

   https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/aits/support/faq/connect-from-home.html

   Option A. Connect to Concordia's VPN
     Step 2  Connecting to the Concordia Network

on how to setup and connect to Concordia's VPN using your Concordia
NETNAME and password.

When setting up your workbench connection to your database use

   Standard TCP/IP

   Hostname : hpc353.encs.concordia.ca
   Port: 3306
   Username: hpc353_2
   Default Schema: hpc353_2
